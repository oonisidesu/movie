# Face Detection Module Dependencies
# ===================================
# Core dependencies for the face detection module of the video face-swapping tool

# Computer Vision and Image Processing
opencv-python>=4.8.0
opencv-contrib-python>=4.8.0

# Numerical Computing
numpy>=1.21.0

# Google MediaPipe for advanced face detection and pose estimation
# Optional but recommended for better accuracy
mediapipe>=0.10.0

# Deep Learning Frameworks (choose one or both based on needs)
# PyTorch - preferred for face swapping models
torch>=2.0.0
torchvision>=0.15.0

# TensorFlow - alternative/additional option
# tensorflow>=2.13.0

# Logging and Utilities
logging

# Optional: For better performance with large images
# Pillow>=9.0.0

# Development and Testing Dependencies (optional)
# pytest>=7.0.0
# pytest-cov>=4.0.0

# Performance optimization (optional)
# numba>=0.57.0  # For JIT compilation of numerical functions
